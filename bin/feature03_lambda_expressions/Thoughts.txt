Pros:
	Lambda Expressions allow us to minimize code and make it more compact.
	Function don't need to be in Classes.
	Lambda Expressions improve readability when chaining operations.
	
Cons:
	Once again, Java is becoming less and less Object Oriented.
	There are too many ways to define interfaces (StringIn_StringOut, T1In_T2Out<T1, T2>, BinaryOperator, more) that feel unrelated.
