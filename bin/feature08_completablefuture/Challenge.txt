Challenge Part 1:
	Using CompletableFuture, process data from two different, asynchronous Rest API calls.
		- Make two API calls (slow them down artificially)
			- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1
			- https://wttr.in/?format=%22%l:+%C+%t%22
		- In a local function, process data from the two calls together
Goal - Do all of this in minimum, highly readable code.


Challenge Part 2:
	Using anything other than CompletableFuture, do the same as Part 1.


Purpose: Compare and Contrast CompletableFuture to another multi-threaded, RestAPI calling technique.
