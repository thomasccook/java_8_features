CompletableFuture

What:
	A Future that may be explicitly completed (setting its value and status), and may be used as a CompletionStage, 
		supporting dependent functions and actions that trigger upon its completion.
		
When:
	Java1.5 had Future's (which didn't have many features)
	Java 8 improved Futures and made CompletableFuture
	
Why: 
	Provides functionality to chain multiple dependent tasks which can be run asynchronously.
		
Notes:
	Packages affected:
		import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;
		import java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException;
		import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
		import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
