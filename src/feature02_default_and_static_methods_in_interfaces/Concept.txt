Feature: Variables, default methods and static methods in Interfaces


What:
	Starting with Java8, Interfaces are no longer purely abstract methods. Methods
	and variables can be put in interfaces.

When:
	Java8+
	
Why: 
	This functionality allows a pseudo-multiple inheritance without the Diamond Problem.
	Java 8 uses default and static methods heavily in Collection API for Lambda Expressions.
	
Notes:
	If you wish to stop iterating, you must throw an exception.
