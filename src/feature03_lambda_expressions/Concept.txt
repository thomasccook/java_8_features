Feature: Lamda Expression

What:
	Let's define a function without having to wrap it up in a Class.
	
When:
	Java8+
	
Why: 
	Java is Object-Oriented. That means any function MUST be defined in an Object, which can be bulky.
	Can we have a function by itself? Lambda Expressions are function not in a Class.
	
Notes:
	The phrase "Lambda Expression" probably comes from the "Lambda Calculus", which was a mathematics system introduced by Alonzo Church in the 1930's.
