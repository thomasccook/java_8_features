Pros:
	Collections, Streams and Lambda functions work together to make much nices looking code.
	Parallel Streams have the possibility of provding multi-threading with very little syntax.
	
Cons:
	The underlying supporting classes of Optional, Function, BiFunction, Predicate, Consumer, 
		Supplier, etc. are awkward ways to define Arguments-in/Arguments-out.
	Streams are convenient if all works well, but hard to debug when things go wrong.
