Challenge:
	Create 4 threads that work together to find prime numbers. 
	All threads write/read/edit/delete to the same ConcurrentHashMap.
	Set parallelismThreshold to 1 for all ConcurrentHashMao operations.
	
	Thread 1: Writes integers 1-100 to the ConcurrentHashMap. Adds a new integer every second.
	Thread 2: Prints the current ConcurrentHashMap. Does this every two seconds.
	Thread 3: Scans the ConcurrentHashMap marking non-primes. Does this every three seconds.
	Thread 4: Scans the ConcurrentHashMao and removes marked non-primes. Does this every four seconds.
		
	In the end, Thread 2 prints all the prime number in order.
