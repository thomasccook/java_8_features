Pros:
	The new API does consist of a nice set of tools, and is one of the better time API's I have seen. I haven't worked with it much yet.
	
Cons:
	Technically, time is a mathematics called "Modular Arithmetic". Time is circles within circles within circles and NOT linear. However, we insist on
		using linear Epoch time (the number of seconds since January 1, 1970) which probably explains why time usage is so awkward. We're using the wrong
		math.
	There are many circles in time
			years
			months
			days
			hours
			seconds
		but this API has a bias towards LocalDate (day circle) and LocalTime (second circle). Why not LocalYear? LocalMonth? LocalHour? LocalSecond? There 
		should be only one class to represent all the many circles of time, so having LocatDate and LocalTime is very biased toward these two circles.
	Basically, this is still an inconsistent and biased view of Time.
	As a programmer, I have watched hundreds of hours being wasted by people resolving time issues, even in the new java.time.* package.
	We need a better model of time.
