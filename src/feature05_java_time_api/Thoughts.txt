Pros:
	The new API does consist of a nice set of tools, and is one of the better time API's I have seen. I haven't worked with it much yet.
	
Cons:
	There are many circles in time
			years
			months
			days
			hours
			seconds
		and this API uses LocalDate (the day circle) and LocalTime (the second circle). Why not LocalYear? LocalMonth? LocalHour? LocalSecond? 
		There should be just one class to represent all the circles.
	
	As a programmer, I have watched hundreds of hours being wasted by people resolving JAva and Javascript time issues, 
	even in the new java.time.* package. We need a better model of time.
