Concept: Composition over Inheritance


What:
	We need models to express data in a computer. But even these models have models. One model is inheritance, and another is composition.
	Inheritance (IS_A ... Java keyword 'extends') represents a place in a hierarchy
	Composition (HAS_A ... Java keyword 'implements') is a list of variables and methods that need to be defined.
	There is a movement that states "Composition over Inheritance".
	
When:
	Design Patterns 1994
	
Why: 
	You need to decide how much Inheritance versus Composition you will do. Tend toward Composition.
	
Notes:
	Some languages, notably Go, use type composition exclusively.
