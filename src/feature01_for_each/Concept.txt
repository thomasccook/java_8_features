Feature: forEach


What:
	forEach traverses a Collection and sends the elements to the implementation of a Consumer class

			public interface Consumer {
			    void accept(T t);
			}

When:
	Java8+
	
Why: 
	This means that you can define business logic in a separate class and reuse it in loops throughout your code.
	
Notes:
	If you wish to stop iterating, you must throw an exception.
