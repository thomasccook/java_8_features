Pros:
	If possible, resuable business logic using 'forEach' and a 'Consumer' is a good idea for consistency and convenience.


Cons:
	Although two loops may be similar, but they are seldom identical, so reusing a non-trivial Consumer may be rare.
	There are many ways to use 'forEach', which makes usage hard to remember.
	Without 'break', 'continue' or an intuitive 'return', the old loops may be better tools.
