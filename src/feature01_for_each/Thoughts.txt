Pros:
	If possible, resuable business logic is a good idea for consistency and convenience.


Cons:
	Two loops may be similar, but they are seldom identical, so reusing a non-trivial inner loop may be rare.
	This forEach seems good for trivial business logic, but providing many, many ways to do something trivial seems not very useful.
